# SurveyFormSimple

This was my second FreeCodeCamp project.

The goal was to make a responsive survey form, giving the style you wanted.
I think i kept it as simple as posible and with the necesary colors.

The most challenging part was the responsive because of the media queries. This is 
somthing that gets better with practice, and i'm happy with the final result.

I'll keep uploading projects as i'll be making them.
